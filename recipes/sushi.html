        This is a recipe of a sushi dish that can easily be made at home. Chefs spend years learning how to make sushi, but this dish should do the trick as your introduction. I love sushi, and I hope you'll love this meal as well.

        You will want to use sushi grade fish, as that is the most important ingridient when it comes to sushi. There are no guarantees that sushi will turn out as good when you make it at home, so you have to put a good deal of effot into it. This delicious recipe is perfect for the occasion.
